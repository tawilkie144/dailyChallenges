Just a colletion of programming problems. I try to work on at least one a day, though depending on work schedule I'll probably miss a day or two. Each file will represent a single day's problem, and will be named the corresponding date. If a particular problem requires more than one class or file, they will be placed in a folder with the date as the name.
